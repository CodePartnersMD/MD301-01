# Class 01: SMACSS and Responsive Web Design

## Overview

There are several components to the daily 301 schedule:
- Each lecture should begin with a warm-up challenge.
  - With the exception of class 01, there is a warm-up folder for each day. The warm-up folder includes the `warm-up.md` for students to review in class and the `NOTES.md` which contains internal notes for the instructor.
  - Plan to spend approximately 15 minutes at the beginning of class on these challenges. Students should have their laptop lids closed and may work independently or with a nearby classmate.
  - In some classes, students will be asked to predict the outcome. 
  - In some classes, students will be asked to find all the bugs in the code and how to fix them.
  - In some classes, students will view samples of code written in JavaScript, Java, Python, or C# and be asked to determine what they think the code is doing.
- Students will complete a set of code challenges each day. 
  - With the exception of class 15, which is focused on final project kickoff, students will be working through a set of code challenges. Each set focuses on string, array, or object methods or regular expressions. The goal of these challenges is to help students feel comfortable and competent working with built-in data manipulation methods. 
  - The corresponding Canvas assignment is sourced from the `challenges/ASSIGNMENT.md` file for each day. This file links out to the demo code in `DEMO.md`, overview in `README.md`, and the Shred Talks playlist (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVngfM2hsbi-L6G8qlWd8RyRbuTamHt3k).
  - Briefly discuss test-driven development and inform students that they will write their own tests in 401. 
  - During lecture on the first day, walk through the workflow for students to complete a challenge. Begin by running the tests and verifying that they all fail at first. Complete one challenge live in front of students and run the tests again, showing that one will pass.
  - Students should be encouraged to add, commit, and push as each test passes.
  - The challenges should take approximately 2-3 hours for students to complete. They should begin working on these challenges at the end of lecture and continue into the evening as needed.
- For classes in the daytime track, lab takes place in the morning following the lecture. Publish the lab assignment between 8:30 and 9:00 a.m. The lab assignment and corresponding retro assignment are due by 1:59 p.m. and are submitted through Canvas.

The 301 schedule with afternoon lectures is a big mindset shift for students who took 201 with morning lectures. Remind students that they should be flexible and consider the afternoon lecture schedule as a way to prepare them for their future jobs. Their boss could approach them with a task and ask for it to be completed by 2 p.m. 

Students who completed Code 201 should have a fundamental understanding of float-based layouts. The corresponding lab assignment will have students working with floats in conjunction with media queries. Emphasize that each box should have a unique color in each view, so a total of 18 unique colors. The wireframes are intentionally greyscale to allow students to decide what colors to use. Introduce students to collections of color schemes [like this one](https://www.canva.com/learn/website-color-schemes/), which can be helpful for those who do not consider themselves creative. 

Students will complete this lab for a second time as part of the lab 5 assignment. The second pass-through will require students to use Flexbox. For courses running afternoon lectures in the day track, this lab will be published and completed on Monday morning prior to lecture 6. 

## How do I prep for today?

- Review float-based layout and read through the requirements for the lab assignment.
- Prepare a demo on media queries and icon fonts from IcoMoon or Font Awesome.
- Prepare a 10-15 demonstration to introduce the topic of today's code challenges.

## What might students struggle with today?

A lot of students do not consider themselves strong in CSS, so provide encouragement to those who need it.

## General comments

## Lecture

Here is the suggested daily schedule for a typical 301 lecture:

### Hour 1

15 minutes - Warm-up challenge: allow time for students to discuss the code with a nearby classmate, then discuss their comments as a class with the instructor

15 minutes - Review the code challenges: ask for a volunteer to write their solution to a challenge on the whiteboard and discuss as a class. If time allows, ask for another volunteer to write their solution to the same challenge or a different challenge.

15 minutes - Introduce the new topic for the upcoming code challenges: continue the flow of discussing code challenges while students are in the mindset

Note: watch the clock carefully as these sections can easily run over time. Take your first 10-minute break early to allow plenty of time to introduce new concepts and write demo code in the second and third hours.

### Hours 2 and 3

Use this time to introduce new concepts and write demo code for students. Break down this time as you see fit.
