# Code 301: ES6 Introduction

This assignment is designed to introduce you to some features in [ECMAScript 2015](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/), otherwise known as ES6. From this point on, you are expected to use these features.

Within this assignment, you'll be working with the following features of ES6:

- Variable declarations with `let` and `const`
- Arrow functions

## Instructions

There are three components to this lab exercise. Please complete them in the following order: 
- Review the `let-const-examples` folder
- Work through the exercises in the `let-const` folder
- Work through the exercises in the `arrow-functions` folder

Fork and then clone the class repository from the link provided by the instructor in Slack into your `~/codefellows/301` directory, and navigate into that repo. Work on your fork on non-master branches. As you work, remember to add, commit, and push regularly.

### Examples of let and const

1. See the adjacent `let-const-examples` folder to compare examples of variable declaration using `let` and `const` with the notation you have been using previously. To work through the examples, open `examples.html` in the browser, open your developer console, and follow the directions on the screen.
1. Once you complete the steps in the `examples.html` file, you are ready to move on to the `let-const` folder.

### Let and const code exercise

1. The `let-const` folder has its own `README.md` file with specific instructions, so read through and follow each step as you complete this exercise. That file also contains the submission instructions for this assignment.
1. Once you have completed and submitted this assignment, you are ready to move on to the `arrow-functions` folder.

### Arrow function code exercise

1. The `arrow-functions` folder has its own `README.md` file with specific instructions, so read through and follow each step as you complete this exercise. That file also contains the submission instructions for this assignment.
1. Once you have completed and submitted this assignment, you are finished with the ES6 practice lab.
